# LLMs
This is my project on LLMs where I implemented a LLM transformer Neural Network from scratch that guides you through building a ChatGPT-style large language model using PyTorch. It helps with hands-on experience covering setup, attention, pretraining, fine-tuning, and text classificationâ€”no external LLM libraries needed.
